Welcome to the My App Documentation

1. **RSA Encryption:**
    - `generate_key_pair()`: This function creates a pair of cryptographic keys â€“ a private key for secure data decryption and a public key for encrypting sensitive information.

    - `serialize_private_key(private_key)`: Converts the private key into a format suitable for storage and later retrieval.

    - `encrypt_message(original_message, public_key)`: Encrypts a given message using the provided public key and return Base64url encoded ciphertext.

    - `deserialize_private_key(serialized_key)`: Deserializes a private key from its serialized PEM format
    
    - `decrypt_message(encrypted_message, private_key)`: Utilizes the private key to decrypt the encrypted message, revealing the original content.


2. **Fernet Encryption:**
    - `generate_key()`: This function generates a secret key for symmetric encryption using Fernet.

    - `encrypt_message_fernet(message)`: Encrypts the given message using Fernet encryption, ensuring confidentiality.

    - `decrypt_message_fernet(encrypted_message)`: Decrypts a Fernet-encrypted message, providing access to the original content.

3. **Django Signer:**
    - `sign_data_signer(message)`: Digitally signs the provided message, adding a layer of authentication.

    - `verify_data_signer(signed_data)`: Verifies the authenticity of a signed message, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with.

4. **Task List:**
    - `task_list(request)`: Displays your current tasks, providing an organized view of ongoing activities.

5. **Error Handling:**
    - If at any point an unexpected error occurs, you will be redirected to an error page (`error.html`), displaying a message describing the issue.

6. **Best Practices:**
    - Keep your cryptographic keys (`private_key`, `public_key`, `signer_secret_key`) secure and never expose them in your code or share them publicly.

    - It's recommended to store sensitive information like the secret key  in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your code.

7. **Task List:**
    - The `task_list(request)` view provides a simple task list interface. You can customize and enhance this functionality based on your specific task management needs.

8. **Security Considerations:**
    - Ensure that your Django application is configured securely. Follow Django best practices for security, including using HTTPS, securing your database, and keeping your Django version up to date.

9. **Customization:**
    - Feel free to customize the provided views (`process_form1`, `process_form2`, `process_form3`, etc.) based on your application's requirements. Add additional features, validation, or UI improvements to enhance the user experience.

10. **Further Assistance:**

How to Use:
- **SETUP ENV:**
    -Set SIGNER_SECRET_KEY,SECRET_KEY in .env file
- **RSA Encryption:**
    - Submit your input using the form in `process_form1(request)`.
    - Receive a secure link that only you can access.
    - Click on the link to unveil your encrypted information using `show_text(request)`.

- **Fernet Encryption:**
    - Enter your text through the form in `process_form2(request)`.
    - Obtain a secure link for accessing the encrypted content.
    - Decode and view the original text using `show_text_fernet(request)`.

- **Django Signer:**
    - Input your text using the provided form in `process_form3(request)`.
    - Receive a digitally signed link for secure sharing.
    - Verify the authenticity of the received message using `show_text_signer(request)`.

Note: Each encryption method provides a unique way to secure and share your information. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to contact me.
